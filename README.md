- **Sales trend analysis**: Evaluation of sales for the different channels.
- **Product category comparison**: An analysis of Goober's various product lines performance between the different store channels.
- **Discount effectiveness**: An assessment of if discounts drive more sales online or in-store.
- **Customer behaviour**: Evaluation of repeating purchase behaviour for different store channels.

## Insights
### Overview of findings
From January 1st 2022 to January 18th 2025, revenue showed no trend and online purchases raised $30,734 more than in-store purchases. Furthermore, the average order value of online sales was 1 higher than those in-store.

Online sales appear to be superior to in-store purchases, with majority of categories leaning towards online, more discounts being applied in that channel, and online customers having a higher median purchase frequency.

### Sales trend analysis
- Sales from both channels **fluctuate heavily** between months, with neither consistently outperforming the other across the entire period the data was collected.
- Majority of the time, online and in-store sales hovered between around $16k and $27k, indicating fairly **stable demand**.
- From December 2024, sales from both channels experienced a **sharp drop** but this can be attributed to the **incompleteness of the data** as the dataset ends mid-January.

### Product category comparison
- Butchers, Beverages, Computers and electronics, Food, Milk Products and Electric household essentials **lean more towards online sales** â€” suggesting customers prefer to purchase these online.
- There is a **considerable descrepancy between online and in-store revenue for Computers and electronics**, with a difference of $16,405. The large online skew suggests customers prefer the convenience of online ordering that allows for better price comparisons and may contain wider product choice.
- Beverages have a sales difference of $996 between channels and Patisserie has a smaller difference of $664. The similar level of sales between online and in-store imply that these categories are channel-agnostic.

### Discount effectiveness
- **Butchers, Electric household essentials, and Milk Products stand out with higher discount volumes online** than in-store with differences of 31, 34, and 38 respectively. These categories' revenue from online sales are greater than in-store, indicating that the discounts are effective.
- **Beverages, Food and Furniture are the only categories with more discounts applied in-store**, with a difference of 11, 11, and 9 respectively compared to online. This could mean Goober is providing more entiing in-store discounts to encourage the purchase of larger quantities or more expensive products in these categories.

### Customer behaviour
